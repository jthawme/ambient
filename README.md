# Spotify Party Display

An ambient display screen for spotify, with the ability to also non destructively add songs to the communal queue.

## Like a Spotify Jam?

Yeah pretty much, in fact much worse. But in _some_ ways better. Gives a more 'there is a Spotify instance running by the host, but if you wanna chuck a couple tunes in, go for it' vibe, rather than full control.

It also protects against the DREADED playlist switch.

## Installing and running

So far, you have to just pull the entire project, run `yarn build` and then you can run the project from `node server` which runs the server and the built sveltekit project
